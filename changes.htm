    <p>We decided to integrate a one page design with sections (About, Recipes, Contact Us) for our website.
            This helps us to simplify our design and give it a more modern look.
            Too add, it is also more efficient to incorporate on one page then to have multiple pages.
            In total we have 1 main page and 10 pages for our different recipes.
            <p></p>
            In addition the navigation scheme has been kept relatively the same with the exeception of reducing the amount of filters to keep it simplified.
            Also, we changed the general theme of the design using more solid colours to make it more accessible.
